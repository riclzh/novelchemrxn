## Two PhD positions available in the laboratory of Dr Richmond Lee (https://scholars.uow.edu.au/display/richmond_lee) at the University of Wollongong, Australia, NSW.

The proposed research blends computational and experimental approach towards the design and development of new catalytic halogenophilic reactions. This involves using state-of-the-art computational chemistry to plan, screen, probe and understand the chemical reactivity of the catalytic reactions. Experimental work will be performed in the synthetic lab of A/Prof. Chris Hyland (UOW) to verify the computational model. The successful applicant(s) will enter UOW as HDR student with an anticipated start date in 2021. 

### Eligibility Criteria
The candidate should possess at least an Honours degree in Chemistry.
The following would also be desirable:
* (a) Further qualifications, e.g. Masters Degree, or relevant research experience demonstrated through appropriate publication records.
* (b) Experience in experimental research related to physical or organic chemistry or catalysis.
* (c) Having computational experience in Unix or any computational chemistry or molecular simulations software would be an added advantage. 

The applicant will need to meet the minimum UOW eligibility criteria for admission (https://www.uow.edu.au/research-and-innovation/graduate-research/admission-information/).

### Application Procedure
Interested applicants should send an email expressing their interest along with scanned copies of their academic transcripts, CV (max 2 page), a brief statement of their research interests and a proposal (max 2 page) and how that specifically links them to this research project. Please send the email expressing interests to Dr Richmond Lee: richlee@uow.edu.au
