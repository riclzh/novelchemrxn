title: "Passing away of Bao Nguyen Do Doan"
---

I am very saddened to find out only recently the sudden passing of my former RA/student Nguyen in a traffic accident in Tuscon, AZ, Dec 2021. 
Nguyen was a passionate chemist, smart and hardworking, and was in the USA to pursue a PhD. 

I was in email contact with him about a month before his fatal accident and only found out from online news regarding this tragic outcome. 

Ngyuen was in my group for a year and learned the ropes of computational chemistry very quickly. Together, we co-authored a paper in which he picked the title. 

My condolences to his family and may he rest in peace.

Sadly, this is my tribute and last recommendation letter to him: [here](https://github.com/riclzh/novelchemrxn/blob/master/files/papers/nguyen.pdf).
