title: "Two PhD positions available!"
---

**Two** PhD positions with three-year funding each are available in the [laboratory of Dr Richmond Lee](https://riclzh.github.io/novelchemrxn/) at the University of Wollongong beginning 2021 as follows:

Computational and experimental design and development of new catalytic halogenophilic reactions. This involves using state-of-the-art computational chemistry to screen, probe and understand the chemical reactivity of the catalytic reactions. After which experiments will be performed in the synthetic lab of A/Prof. Chris Hyland to verify the model. 

The successful applicant(s) will enter UOW as HDR student with an anticipated start date in 2021. Candidates with previous experience in organic chemistry and catalysis is desirable and having computational experience in Unix or any computational chemistry or molecular simulations software would be an added advantage. 

Please email a cover letter explaining your interest in the position, qualifications, details of 2 academic referees and a CV to Dr Lee: richlee@uow.edu.au
