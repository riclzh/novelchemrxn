**MUST READ** if you are starting on comp chem projects. 

Here are some papers discussing how to write interesting computational chem papers and get them published, pitfalls and perspectives on the field:

[Pitfalls in Computational Modeling of Chemical Reactions and How To Avoid Them](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.organomet.8b00456)

[Scope and Challenge of Computational Methods for Studying Mechanism and Reactivity in Homogeneous Catalysis](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acscatal.9b01537)

[How Accurate is DFT for Iridium-Mediated Chemistry?](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.organomet.6b00377)

[How To Make Your Computational Paper Interesting and Have It Published](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.organomet.8b00942)
